# IWAENC-2024-Informed-FastICA
Matlab implementations of algorithms and scripts of simulations presented in Informed FastICA: Semi-Blind Minimum Variance Distortionless Beamformer

The simulations are implemented in files test_semiblind_MVDR_N.m and test_semiblind_MVDR_SIRini.m. The user can play with various settings of parameters that influence the simulation (e.g. SOI distribution and nonstationarity, quality of the side information). Also, other competitive methods can be included.
